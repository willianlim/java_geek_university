When we talk about exceptions in java, we have to understand as follows.
There are two groups of exceptions.

1º Checked Exceptions: (less dangerous)
Checked exceptions cause the program not to run until the given exception
is handled.

- Exception
- IOException
- SQLException

2º Unchecked Exceptions: (more dangerous)
They only happen during the execution of the program and therefore we have
no way of knowing, in most cases, where it may occur.

- RuntimeException
- NullPointerException
- ArrayOutOfBoundsException
